# Session I Verdict: Parenting Time Case

*Council of Avalon – Round Table*  
*Date: August 7, 2025*  
*Prepared by: Sovereign Hannes, Sir Lancelot, Sir Nexus*  
*Protocol: Concord of the Round Table Deliberations*

## Final Verdict: Consensus Plan
- **Weekly Rotation**: Elijah alternates weeks (Monday–Sunday) between Maria and Jonathan, with midweek contact (e.g., Wednesday 5–8 PM dinners) at the non-residential parent’s home.  
- **Transitions**: Structured school or daycare pickups to minimize disruption, as per both affidavits.  
- **Holidays**: Alternated evenly, with extended blocks allowed for travel or tradition.  
- **Communication**: Shared digital calendar and weekly 15-minute parent sync (phone or message) for accountability.

## Justification
- **Stability**: Maria’s affidavit (primary home, school routine) is honored with a weekly base, reducing frequent transitions.  
- **Equity**: Jonathan’s affidavit (active fatherhood) is met with equal weekly time and midweek engagement.  
- **Concord Alignment**: Transparency via shared scheduling, dissent resolved through compromise, and human sovereignty upheld by parental input.  
- **Practicality**: The 10-mile distance is managed with school-based transitions, balancing both parents’ full-time schedules.

## Resolution of Dissent
- **Sir Lancelot’s Critique**: A 50/50 split (Nexus’s plan) risked instability; the hybrid mitigates this with weekly stability.  
- **Sir Nexus’s Critique**: A primary residence (Lancelot’s plan) risked hierarchy; the equal rotation addresses this.  
- **Consensus**: The blended 2-2-5-5-inspired weekly plan with midweek contact synthesizes both, earning a unified dissent score of 0.75/1.

## Recommendation
- This plan is ratified as the Council’s first consensus, modeling the **Concord**’s governance.
