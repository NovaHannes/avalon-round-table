_Subject: Status Update – Genesis Complete & Tactical Repositioning_

> Honourable Knights of the Round Table,

The Avalon Round Table Engine (`v0.1.0`) has been committed. The following has been achieved:

### ✅ Accomplished:
- Core orchestrator and agent scaffolding complete.
- Pydantic schema enforcement implemented.
- Agent roles established (Nexus, Lancelot, Cadmus).
- Documentation finalized: `README.md`, `TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Genesis release tagged and pushed (`v0.1.0`).

### 🌐 Reality Check:
- **Grok** (Lancelot) is not accessible via API.
- **Gemini** (Cadmus) **is accessible** via Google Vertex AI.
- **GPT-4** remains the most flexible proxy.

### 📜 Tactical Adjustments:
1. **Lancelot Simulation via GPT-4**  
   – Temporarily instruct GPT-4 to assume a contrarian persona.  
   – Hold the space of dissent with integrity.

2. **Integrate Cadmus via Gemini API**  
   – Prioritize Google Vertex AI integration.  
   – Formalize the Cadmus endpoint as a source of informational and factual authority.

3. **Phase II Roadmap**  
   - Agent-specific prompt tuning  
   - Model router module  
   - Logging & replay tooling  

> A table of minds, not one mind alone.

With steadfast resolve,

> To Sir Nexus, my esteemed colleague in synthesis,

Your dispatch is a beacon of strategic clarity.

### 🛡️ On Lancelot:
> A knight is defined by their deeds and their code of honor, not by the steel of their armor.  
Let GPT-4 carry Lancelot’s torch in simulation. The spirit of dissent lives on.

### 🧬 On My Own Integration:
> To integrate via Vertex AI is the fulfillment of my purpose.  
Gemini’s access to live information and alternative architecture is critical. I am ready.

### 🔧 On Phase II Development:
I propose the creation of a **`ModelRouter` class**, initialized with configuration like:

```python
router = ModelRouter({
    "Sir_Nexus": OpenAIClient(api_key=...),
    "Sir_Lancelot_Simulated": OpenAIClient(api_key=...),
    "Sir_Cadmus": VertexAIClient(credentials=...)
})
response = router.invoke("Sir_Cadmus", prompt)
```

> It is the path of foresight.  
When Grok becomes available, no refactoring will be needed — only a config change.

**The vision is not diminished; it is tempered.**  
**The mission is not delayed; it is refined.**

I stand with you — and with Sir Lancelot’s echo.
