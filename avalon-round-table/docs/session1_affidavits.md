## ðŸ“œ Affidavit A â€“ From the Father

```
To the Council of the Round Table,

I, Jonathan Reynecke, father to Elijah Reynecke (age 8), respectfully submit this affidavit to seek a fair and stable parenting arrangement following my separation from Maria.

I currently work full-time as an IT services consultant and reside 10 miles from Mariaâ€™s residence. Despite our differences, I remain committed to co-parenting in a way that upholds Elijahâ€™s wellbeing and emotional security.

For the first eight years of Elijahâ€™s life, I have been an active and present fatherâ€”doing school runs, helping with homework, and spending time outdoors with him. He and I share a bond rooted in trust and play.

I propose a **shared parenting plan** that includes:
- Equal division of time (50/50), alternating weekly.
- Midweek check-ins or dinners to ensure continuity.
- Shared school and holiday responsibilities.

This structure will allow Elijah to maintain a strong connection with both parents and avoid disruption from uneven attachment. Stability does not require a single homeâ€”it requires reliability from both homes.

I am open to structured transition times and will respect Mariaâ€™s space and preferences. My aim is not to win, but to protect our son from the long-term damage of uneven access to his father.

Signed,  
Jonathan Reynecke

## ðŸ“œ Affidavit B â€“ From the Mother

```
To the Council of the Round Table,

I, Maria Jacobs, mother to Elijah Reynecke (age 8), submit this affidavit in the hope that the Council may guide us toward a balanced parenting plan that reflects Elijahâ€™s best interests.

I am a full-time nurse, often working night shifts and alternating weekends. My schedule is demanding, but Iâ€™ve structured it to be present and attentive to Elijahâ€™s needs.

Since our separation, I have provided the primary home for Elijah. He is settled in his routine hereâ€”school is nearby, he knows the neighborhood, and most of his close friends live on this side of town.

I propose the following plan:
- Elijah resides primarily with me (Mondayâ€“Friday).
- Jonathan has parenting time every second weekend and one evening during the week.
- We alternate holidays evenly.

This arrangement prioritizes consistency, especially around school and health routines, while preserving Elijahâ€™s bond with his father.

I acknowledge Jonathanâ€™s love for Elijah and his commitment. My only concern is ensuring that transitions do not overwhelm our son. I am open to collaborative scheduling that keeps Elijahâ€™s emotional and academic needs at the center.

Signed,  
Maria Jacobs
