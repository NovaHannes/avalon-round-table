# Avalon – Round Table Engine (ARTE)

**ARTE** is a multi-agent AI framework for ethical deliberation.  
Born from the Avalon Concord, it seeks truth, dissent, and consensus without Machiavellian manipulation.  
It is part of the **Nova Company** initiative.

---

## 🧭 Overview

ARTE enables transparent, structured decision-making across domains, starting with **Session I**, a family law mediation exercise.  
The framework simulates AI agents (e.g., Sir Lancelot, Sir Nexus) deliberating toward a just outcome, with fictional case files, transcripts, and outputs published publicly.
